1. Build the library as:
```bash
zig build-lib mylib.zig
```

2. Run the main file as:
```bash
zig build run
```

The `exe.exe` file is the executable file that was built from your `main.zig` source file. You can run this file to execute your program.

The `exe.pdb` file is a Program Database (PDB) file that contains debugging information for your `exe.exe` executable. This file is generated by the Zig compiler when building your executable in debug mode. The debugging information in the PDB file can be used by a debugger to help you debug your program.

If you don't need to debug your program, you can safely ignore the `exe.pdb` file. If you want to reduce the size of your executable and speed up the build process, you can build your executable in release mode by passing the `-Drelease-safe=true` or `-Drelease-fast=true` option to the `zig build` command. This will build your executable without generating a PDB file.

The `mylib.lib` file is a static library file that was built from your `mylib.zig` source file. A static library is a collection of object files that can be linked with other object files to create an executable or another library. In your case, the `mylib.lib` file contains the object code for the `add` function defined in your `mylib.zig` file.

The `mylib.lib.obj` file is an intermediate object file that was generated by the Zig compiler when building the `mylib.lib` static library. This file contains the compiled object code for the `mylib.zig` source file. The Zig compiler combines this object file with other object files (if any) to create the final `mylib.lib` static library.

You can link against the `mylib.lib` static library when building your `exe` executable to use the `add` function from the library in your program. The `mylib.lib.obj` file is an intermediate file that is used by the Zig compiler during the build process and can be safely ignored.

Yes, you can reduce the size of the `mylib.lib` and `exe.exe` files by building them in release mode. When building in release mode, the Zig compiler applies optimizations to the generated code to make it smaller and faster.

To build your `mylib.lib` static library in release mode, you can pass the `-O ReleaseSafe` or `-O ReleaseFast` option to the `zig build-lib` command like this:
```
zig build-lib mylib.zig -O ReleaseSafe
```
or
```
zig build-lib mylib.zig -O ReleaseFast
```

To build your `exe.exe` executable in release mode, you can pass the `-Drelease-safe=true` or `-Drelease-fast=true` option to the `zig build` command like this:
```
zig build -Drelease-safe=true
```
or
```
zig build -Drelease-fast=true
```

The `-O ReleaseSafe` and `-Drelease-safe=true` options will build your library and executable with optimizations for code size and safety. The `-O ReleaseFast` and `-Drelease-fast=true` options will build your library and executable with optimizations for maximum performance, but may result in larger code size.

After building your library and executable in release mode, you should see that their sizes have been reduced compared to when building in debug mode.
